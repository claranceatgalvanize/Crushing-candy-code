## Crushing Candy Code

A local chain of candy stores has hired you to draw conclusions from their sales data. This is made difficult by the fact that each store keeps track of their own inventory sales in a slightly different manner. Use the data sets contained in each folder to complete the exercises.

### Setup

1. Fork and clone the repo down to your local environment.
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to get testing packages.

### Recommended execution of these exercises

Write your code as functions that return the result and then run `npm test ./test/store[#].test.js` on the command line.

For example:

```bash
npm test ./test/store1.test.js
```

### Tips

* Be sure to review dot notation vs. bracket notation and when you need to use one over the other.

* If you're stuck on a problem, move on to a new problem! Maybe you'll learn something new in a different problem that will help!

* The challenge questions are _not_ required.
